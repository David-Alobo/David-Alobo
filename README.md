I am a Data Analytics Alumni of Udacity and a second-class upper graduate of Industrial Chemistry from Olabisi Onabanjo University in Ago-Iwoye. I have over 8 years of industry experience, spanning the public and private sectors.

I focus on businesses that employ data analytics to boost growth. I was the first data analyst employed by Evercare Hospital Lekki, where I deployed business intelligence and several forms of artificial intelligence to enhance patient care.

I intentionally turn fact into knowledge because I am convinced that having more knowledge will give anybody greater confidence when making decisions. Hence, I have taken a step further in enabling data-driven decisions by moving beyond standard analytics and working with key stakeholders and technology leaders to develop enterprise solutions that scale. 

I bring my wealth of expertise as a Data Analytics Practitioner and Mentor along with my passion for capacity building into any organisation to drive growth.

Presently, I am a Visiting Researcher with the Cronin Group, University of Glasgow, UK where I am working on Chemical Synthesis using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning that finds application in Drug Discovery.
