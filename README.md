I am a Data Analytics Alumni of Udacity and a second-class upper graduate of Industrial Chemistry from Olabisi Onabanjo University in Ago-Iwoye. I have over 7 years of industry experience, spanning the public and private sectors.

I focus on businesses that employ data analytics to boost growth. I was the first data analyst employed by Evercare Hospital Lekki, where I deployed business intelligence and several forms of artificial intelligence to enhance patient care.

I intentionally turns fact into knowledge because I am convinced that having more knowledge will give anybody greater confidence when making decisions. I have taken a step further in enabling data-driven decisions by moving beyond standard analytics and working with key stakeholders and technology leaders to develop enterprise solutions that scale. 

I bring my wealth of expertise as a Data Analytics Practitioner and Mentor along with my passion for capacity building into any organisation to drive growth.

In the near future, I plan to conduct studies in the field of chemoinformatics on finding drugs to treat cancer.

Please get in touch with me if you are seeking for an intern or research student in the field of my interest.
